# clothing store project

This is a project that seeks to recreate an inventory system. It is sought that the user has the comfort of adding products without the need
to do everything manually.

# Things that are integrated in the current version:

-It has output management (which takes into account the modifications of the quantities, and the changes that are made in these), which only works with existing products.

-It has good input handling (which takes into account whether a product exists or not)

-It has a manual creation of new products in case you do not need to register an entry

-It has a record of invoices, customers and suppliers

-It has a process of remembering the theme that we have chosen every time the App is started

-It has complete lists of all invoices in the database, from suppliers, and even from customers


# promises:

-An interface improvement (more intuitive), and much more attractive

-A bug reporting system

-a login

-settings

-Load, overwrite, create and show excel tables

-Keyboard shortcuts that avoid being glued to the mouse


In this project I use the MVC and the MYSQL database to be able to manage the data and that queries can be made in a simple and easy way. The current version in which it is developed is Java 17 with the Eclipse Termurin JDK

# Note:

If you want to add your database and use it to test the project, I recommend doing so with phpMyAdmin, since that's what I used to create most of it.
